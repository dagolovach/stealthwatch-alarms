Begin by running a Top Ports (outbound) report. Set the time period to the day of the event and the client host to be the source IP of the event. Regardless of the target IP range that is listed, you can scan any type of host, so determine if you want to search on inside hosts, outside hosts, or both. On the Hosts tab in the Filter dialog, set the Server filter as appropriate, and on the Advanced tab, set the \"Order the records returned by\" to Flows. Sort the results by peers. Regardless, start at the top of the list as sorted by flows or peers to find the standout ports that either do not belong or appear abnormally high. Right-click an IP address to pivot to the flows to view the various IP addresses and determine if par-ticular host groups are those being primarily targeted. You can also right- click and pivot to the Top Peers report to determine whether or not the traffic is spread generally equally across the targets.
